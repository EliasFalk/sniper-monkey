Group: Sniper Monkey
Date: 22/9 - 2021
Chair: Elias Falk
Participants: Dadi Andrason, Elias Falk, Vincent Hellner, Kevin Jeryd


## Objectives
- How we should implement player states in code.
- How to task.

## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- The solution suggested by the examiner was not applicable to our program so a new message was sent to the examiner.
- Elias, Vincent and Kevin have discussed the PlayerController and Player state machine and how it fits into MVC. The controller solution will be to have a hash with inputs on the player which is set by the controller.
- Dadi has implemented part of fighter switch functionality.

## Discussion items (35 min)

- Player states
- The new message sent to the examiner
- Discuss tasks before assigning the user story?


## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

The player will have a few different states: grounded, inAir, attacking and blocking. Each state will check the inputs set by the controller and change the player and its state accordingly.

The group is still waiting for a response from the examiner regarding MVC because he has not responded “(Han igga oss)” (Sadge).
We will discuss some if not all the tasks before we assign a user story with the tasks to a member in order to not overlap tasks.


## Wrap up
Next meeting: Next week
