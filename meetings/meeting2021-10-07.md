## Objectives (5 min)

## Reports (15 min) from previous meeting
- Everyone has done tests and documentation. Almost everything is now documented and tested.
- Elias, Vincent and Kevin have worked a bit on a better physics system but it is not finalized.
- Everyone has worked on RAD, everyone has written at least 2 user stories.


## Discussion items (35 min)
- GUI, HUD, attacks, physics.
- Divide our design model into packages.
- Work or SDD before hand-in.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
- GUI, HUD and attacks are the main priorities since those are the things left to make the game mostly playable. Good physics are not as important.
- SDD & RAD needs to be “finished” ASAP.


## Wrap up
- Kevin and Dadi will work on attacks
- Vincent and Elias will work on the HUD
- Everyone need to “finish” RAD & SDD.
