- We identified some issues in the domain model such as missing objects and other minor details.
- Are we going to make a figma design?
- What is more important: user stories to tasks or building on the domain model?
- We donâ€™t have any prototyping, could be beneficial to do.

## Outcomes and assignments (5 min)- Outcomes from discussion items. Write down what's decided and why it was decided. Sync with other documentation (add terms to wordbook).- (re)Assign to each group member which issues to solve.
- Added some objects in the domain model and decided that more details are needed for the second iteration.
- We are making a simpler figma design.
- We decided that building on the domain model is more important.
- We need to do some simple prototyping. This would include keyboard inputs, asset loading, collision, movement.

- Elias and Dadi makes the figma design
- Vincent and Kevin makes a second iteration of the domain model
- The whole group will work on a simple prototype.

## Wrap up- Write down any unresolved issues for next meeting.- Decide a time and location for next meeting.
